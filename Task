# Stabilizing the Industrial Trading Platform

- [x] Rebuild Hero: Remove heavy dark slate. Use white/light background. Shift H1 to "Hydraulic & Industrial Hose Supply Across UAE". Shift primary CTA to Blue, secondary to Outline. Move emergency to a small text strip.
- [x] Restore Product Images: Bring back minimal, technical images (close-up hose, stainless fitting) for the Products section. Maintain neutral styling (no shadows, no rounding).
- [x] Refine Portfolio / Record of Capability: Structure as Project Type, Scope, Equipment Supported, Outcome to keep it calm and data-driven.
- [x] Rebalance Color Psychology: Ensure Blue is primary, Grey is secondary, and Red is strictly an accent (not dominant).

- [x] Integrate the Premium Brand Intro to the About section to balance the tone between strict industrial authority and commercial accessibility.
